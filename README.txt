Computer Specifications:
- This game was made on a windows 64 bit computer and I think it will only work on another windows 64 bit computer
- This game was designed around a 1920x1080 screen resolution but should work with other resolutions, 
  just some of the images might be distorted
- You shouldn't need pygame or even python to run the game but you will need python to look at the uploaded code

If running the game isn't working or it crashes when you click play and it finishes the count down:
- install pygame
- create a folder and place the python file uploaded in it
- place the images and sounds folders from the build file in the folder with the python file
- place the freesansbold.ttf file in this same folder
- place the README file in the folder if you want to keep track of everything
- run the python code
- exit the game and make sure a gamedata folder was created
